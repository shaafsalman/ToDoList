# ToDoList Application

A simple Android to-do list application that allows users to manage their tasks efficiently. Users can add, view, and complete tasks, with tasks stored persistently in a JSON file.

## Features

- **Add New Tasks**: Users can create new tasks with a title and description.
- **View Active Tasks**: Active tasks are displayed, allowing users to keep track of their ongoing tasks.
- **View Completed Tasks**: Completed tasks can be viewed separately, providing a clear distinction between active and finished tasks.
- **Task Management**: Users can mark tasks as completed, which removes them from the active list.
- **Persistent Storage**: Tasks are saved in a JSON file, ensuring data persistence even after the app is closed.
